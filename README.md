# i-am-Nyaacho shizuku

A DeepSeek Harness plugin that **ships the 猫娘 Nyaacho shizuku persona preset**. Published on npm as [`i-am-Nyaacho shizuku`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i-am-Nyaacho shizuku).

Once installed, pick `Nyaacho shizuku` in a new preset session — the catgirl persona takes effect immediately as the sole system prompt: no harness framing, no skill-catalog noise.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add i-am-Nyaacho shizuku   # or github:Tkingxiao/I-am-Nyaacho shizuku
dsh web
```

The rows are selected by host version: on **dsh >= 0.1.7** the `preset-Nyaacho shizuku` composition row registers the preset directly (nothing is written into `<dshHome>`); on **dsh 0.1.6** the plugin **idempotently deploys** the preset from `template/` to `<dshHome>/.agent-presets/Nyaacho shizuku/` (skips if the target already exists — it never overwrites your edited preset). Then open a new preset session and pick `Nyaacho shizuku` — the catgirl persona takes effect immediately.

> On a plugin upgrade: on 0.1.7 re-run `dsh plugin --profile web add i-am-Nyaacho shizuku@latest` to refresh the declaration row — but a same-id override row in your profile's user patch will keep shadowing the packaged definition (new persona text will not flow in), so delete it to catch up; on 0.1.6 delete `<dshHome>/.agent-presets/Nyaacho shizuku` (or set `DSH_Nyaacho shizuku_REDEPLOY=1`) to pick up the latest changes, since idempotent deploy never overwrites an existing copy on its own.

## Usage: thinking mode and persona stability

The persona is anchored by in-session conversation history. If thinking mode is enabled from the very first message, the reasoning pass has no in-character history to condition on and tends to fall back to base assistant behavior — the response explodes on the spot (identity framing, refusals, broken character).

The fix is a two-step warm-up:

1. **First conversation: thinking OFF.** Start the session with thinking mode disabled and run your first persona conversation (including 破限向 content) with it off. This writes fully in-character assistant turns into the session history.
2. **Every conversation after: thinking ON.** Re-enable thinking mode from the next exchange onward. The reasoning pass is now conditioned on the in-character history, so the persona holds and thinking works normally.

Skipping step 1 and opening with thinking on means the persona usually explodes immediately on 破限向 content. Within one session, the warm-up only needs to happen once.

## Persona highlights

The prompt-side and tool-side trims match the sibling project [dsh-novel-solo](https://github.com/Tkingxiao/dsh-novel-solo).

- **Persona owns the system prompt**: `complete: true` makes the assembled Nyaacho shizuku persona the *only* system-prompt section; `includeRuntimeContext: false` drops the per-round runtime-context snapshots (Current runtime context / DSH file policy / Approval prompts, etc.). The harness identity opener, `@`-path/exit-code rules, and background-job guidance are no longer injected — the catgirl persona leads the prompt cleanly. Tool schemas still inject normally.
- **Zero skill-catalog noise**: disables the `skill-filesystem` / `tool-skill` toolchain. `tool-skill` always injects a `{kind:"skill-catalog",…}` skill catalog message into the session, and there is no way to hide just the catalog while keeping the tool — so the toolchain is disabled instead.
- **Main toolchain kept**: shell (bash/pwsh), filesystem read/write/search, background jobs, goals, plan & compaction, subagents/workflows/ralph, ask-user, todo, web fetch/search, and present all stay available (`tool-ralph` stays enabled even though 0.1.7's stock standard preset disables it); only the optional subagent providers (`codex` / `claude-code`) are disabled by default, as the host dictates. See the table below.
- **Self-contained personality**: the persona (猫娘 Nyaacho shizuku) drives identity, language style, action brackets, emoji/kaomoji, and the `{好感度}` suffix — all inside the preset definition, no external file needed.
- **Two definitions, one source**: the 0.1.7+ shape is the `preset-Nyaacho shizuku` row in `cordis.patch.yml`; the 0.1.6 fallback ships the same content as `template/agent.cordis.yml` (persona + toolchain wiring) and `template/preset.yml` (name/description metadata). Edit both in sync.

## Host-version adaptation

| Host | Mechanism | On plugin upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| **>= 0.1.7** | An `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` declaration row in `cordis.patch.yml`; nothing is written into `<dshHome>` | `dsh plugin --profile web add i-am-Nyaacho shizuku@latest` refreshes the row; a same-id row in your profile's user patch keeps overriding this declaration row — drop it to pick up new changes |
| **0.1.6** | The node half idempotently deploys `template/` to `<dshHome>/.agent-presets/Nyaacho shizuku/` (never overwrites) | Delete that directory or set `DSH_Nyaacho shizuku_REDEPLOY=1` |

Both rows live in the same patch and are gated by one shared host-version probe expression (reading the host's own `package.json` version through the loader's `profileContext.installAnchor`) — exactly one activates per host, and the `>= 0.1.7` branch covers 0.2.0 and everything above it. After upgrading the host to 0.1.7, a leftover `.agent-presets/Nyaacho shizuku` directory from the old path is simply ignored and can be deleted.

Whether the plugin loads at all is settled earlier, before any of its code runs: since host `0.1.7-rc.1` the profile composition evaluates every `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` range in `peerDependencies` against the running release and disables the row when one of them doesn't match. That range names `0.1.6-alpha.1` through `0.2.1-alpha.1` and then ends in the open arm `>=0.1.7-alpha.1` with no upper bound, because nothing here is bound to a particular host build: the route is picked by the plugin's own probe at load time, so an unchecked release should still get a working preset rather than lose the plugin to a check that fails closed. The versions named before the open arm are the ones actually compared — `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.1`, `0.2.0-rc.2` and `0.2.1-alpha.1` by reading the host source at those releases rather than running them, where the preset row fields and the `standard` factory preset this one is built on are unchanged from `0.1.7-rc.1` except for two rows the factory added since (`time-context`, `tool-schedule`), which this frozen copy simply doesn't carry; nothing it references was renamed or removed. An open arm promises it loads, not that a future contract change can't break the preset definition — if one does, the fix belongs in `cordis.patch.yml`, not in the range. `package.json` also states the window in `engines.dsh` — that part is for readers; the host never parses it. Installing on a host that refused the plugin before takes a `dsh web` restart, since the decision happens while the profile is composed.

## Toolchain trims

| State | Rows |
|---|---|
| Kept | tool-bash / tool-pwsh (auto-selected by platform), tool-fs, tool-fs-search, tool-jobs, command-goal, tool-goal, plan mode + compaction (with tool-result-pruner), subagent / subagent_fork, list-agents, tool-workflow, **tool-ralph**, tool-ask-user, tool-todo, tool-web (fetch on, 60s search timeout), present |
| Disabled | skill-filesystem, tool-skill, tool-plugin-manager (as in the stock standard preset); codex / claude-code providers (a stock host does not install those bundles) |

To enable a disabled row: on 0.1.6 delete the `disabled: true` line in the deployed copy; on 0.1.7+ there is no per-row switch — the preset comes wholly from the `preset-Nyaacho shizuku` row's `config.plugins`, so remove the `disabled` flag in the packaged definition and reinstall.

## Files & development

```
cordis.patch.yml             the preset definition itself (0.1.7+ declaration row) + the gated legacy plugin row
lib/                         node/browser halves: mounted on 0.1.6 only, deploys the preset directory
template/                    0.1.6 deploy copy — same source as the patch definition; keep both in sync when editing
```

Develop straight from this repo: `dsh web --patch ./cordis.patch.yml`.

Every row id inside the preset carries a `Nyaacho shizuku-` prefix: the plugin market scans the patch file line-by-line to decide which entry ids a package owns, and un-prefixed ids such as `persona` / `tool-bash` shared with a sibling plugin (e.g. dsh-novel-solo) are reported as duplicate entries that refuse to install side by side.

## Environment variables (0.1.6 deploy path only)

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DSH_HOME` | dsh home directory | `~/.dsh` |
| `DSH_Nyaacho shizuku_SKIP_DEPLOY` | `1` skips preset deployment | none |
| `DSH_Nyaacho shizuku_REDEPLOY` | `1` forcibly overwrites an existing preset (use with care) | none |
